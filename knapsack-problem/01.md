# Knapsack 01 Problem

A thief breaks into an apartment and needs to steal some items, each with a certain value and weight. He has brought a backpack with a limited capacity and must fill it with these items in such a way as to achieve the maximum possible value inside the backpack.

## Input parameters

- `weights`: items weights
- `values`: items values
- `knapsackCapacity`: total knapsack capacity

## Output

Returns the maximum profit

## Pseudo-code

```
knapsack_01(weights, values, knapsackCapacity)
    numItems = length(values)

    // Create a table where each cell will represent
    // the maximum profit obtainable with:
    // - the first i items (row i)
    // - knapsack capacity j (column j)

    // Base case: empty knapsack or no available items
    for i = 0 to numItems:
        table[i][0] = 0
    for c = 0 to knapsackCapacity:
        table[0][c] = 0

    // For each item
    for i = 1 to numItems:
        // For each possible knapsack capacity
        for cap = 1 to knapsackCapacity:

            // If the item is too heavy, we cannot include it
            if cap < weights[i]:
                // Take the maximum value without considering this item
                table[i][cap] = table[i - 1][cap]

            // Otherwise, take the maximum between:
            else:
                // 1. Not including the current item
                profitWithout = table[i - 1][cap]

                // 2. Including the current item
                profitWith = values[i] + table[i - 1][cap - weights[i]]

                // Store the maximum value
                table[i][cap] = max(profitWithout, profitWith)

    // The maximum value is found in the last cell of the table
    return table[numItems][knapsackCapacity]
```
